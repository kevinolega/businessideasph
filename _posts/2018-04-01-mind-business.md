When you're passionate about your work, it's easy to get carried away.

Maybe you're happy or excited with your employer's or your client's mission, you go all in to deliver quality work and sometimes at the cost of your personal well being.

According to Seth Godin, and I paraphrase, business is good when:

1. You produce a result that is valuable to a client.
2. You are able to produce the results for as long as the client needs said result.

That said, the ability to be consistent at delivering great service is a key to delivering value.

Great performance and results have less to do with commitment, discipline, willpower, planning and all these great ingredients that we attribute to a good worker or business owner.

A great performance has more to do with the small things that we often pay little attention to.

1. How much sleep have you had?
2. Did you eat well?
3. Are you happy and inspired?
4. Do you feel confident and supported?
5. Do you feel physical energy flowing through your body?

We often get angry at ourselves for not feeling motivated or drained and we try to push forward with willpower and the results are often like swinging with all we got but hitting nothing but air.

Performance expert Tony Robbins shared in one of his lessons that when the body lacks sleep or energy, discipline and intelligence are often the first positive attributes to go out the window.

If you are faithful with the small things, you are expected to do well with the big things.

If this is true, then what can you do?

Here are some suggestions:

**1. Attempt to do less.**

If a task isn't important or there would be no consequences for not doing it, stop doing it. Putting in more effort at an unimportant task won't make it any more important.

**2. Identify key tasks**

Out of a list of twenty tasks, it's usually two or four of those are the most important. Learn to identify those tasks. Do those tasks well and excel. One challenge is often, all tasks look important but one question you can ask yourself is, what task, when completed will make your other tasks easier or unnecessary?


**3. Take better care of yourself**

What is missing in your life? Where are you doing poorly in terms of physical maintenance? How about mental? How about emotional? How about financial? How about relationships? How about spirirtual? What is missing? What can you do to take better care of that area? Who can you ask for help?

**4. Get some help**

If you can't do something well, perhaps you can get help from someone who does that exact thing well. If you're trying to force yourself to do something that you hate, your day to day will always feel like fighting an uphill battle. Consider that someone loves to do the task that you hate. Ask that person to do that and pay them instead of wasting your day often not getting anything important done.

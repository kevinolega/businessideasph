One of the key messages of Tim Ferriss in the book, The Four Hour Workweek is about eustress.

Eustress is good stress.

The prefix "eu" like in Euphoria means good.

Distress is harmful stress.

You avoid distress, and welcome eustress.

After reading that, one might be inclined to go after as much eustress as possible.

It's easy to miss the point.

If you want to do the impossible, you need to learn from people who do seemingly impossible things regulary.

After observing the lessons from Tim Ferriss, I concluded that Tim approaches receiving eustress like an athlete would.

Constant small doses.

Not anything big but consistent small doses.

Tim says he always follow a barbell approach.

From what I understand in weightlifting. 

You can take your comfortable weight for a lift, work with that comfortable weight for a few weeks without increasing, just working on your form and execution then  after two weeks you may add 5 lbs. 

Then after another two weeks you add another 5lbs.

Then you repeat the process.

The process is incredibly boring but after six months, doing so enables you to lift an extra 60 pounds in six months and an extra 120lbs after a year or more.

If you practice in this manner, it's not difficult to imagine progressing to lifting up to around 400lbs in three years or so.

One thing I notice with Tim Ferriss approach is he prefers consistency and small progress when taking action. 

He applies the eustress to selecting the most important and cutting out the unimportant.

#### Here's how to take action:

1. List down all the causes of your personall and business stress?
2. Identify distress (what is not helping you)
3. Identify eustress (what is helping you)
4. Ask yourself "How can I expose myself to small doses of eustress regularly?"
5. Add eustress activities to your calendar schedule.

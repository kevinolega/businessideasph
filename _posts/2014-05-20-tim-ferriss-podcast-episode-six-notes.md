<p>This is a review of the Tim Ferriss podcast. </p>
<p>I"m a fan Tim Ferriss and his work in the four hour workweek and the four hour chef. I learned how to live more and have better quality life as a result of the lessons. Recently, Tim had started a podcast where he talks about his topics of interest. This week he launched an experimental podcast where he read an essay on decision making and the use of positive constraints. </p>
<p>Here"s what I picked up from the podcast. </p>
<p>Regret is past tense decision making. </p>
<p>Have parameters to limit options. </p>
<p>Positive constraints are self imposed limitations that enable me to be more effective. </p>
<p>If something costs 10% more and you can get it now, instead of using the time to minimize the cost, buy the damn thing and consider it an investment in the quality of your life. (Side note, my dad scolded me because I wanted to canvas further after finding a salad spinner worth five hundred when all the previous items I found were worth a few thousand pesos. He said I won"t get to keep the extra money that I saved because I will be using <a href="http://www.svenskkasinon.com/">casino pa natet</a>  my productive time looking for the item, even if I save another Php 200 from the effort I would have EDT requires the learner to undertake training covering certain high risk <a href="http://best-driving-school.com/">best-driving-school.com</a> aspects; the ADI will reflect the learner"s progress in the feedback in the logbook. used an extra 2-4 hours and that would have negated what I thought was a discount. I"m ultimately cheating myself. So the lesson is if the results were negligible then just buy the damn thing. )</p>
<p>I remember how I got to buy my iPad mini case. I bought one at a hundred pesos. I"m not really happy with it. I found one that I liked however, it was a one thousand seven hundred bucks and they offered a screen protector to sweeten the deal I felt it was expensive so I looked around. You can find a cheap case for five hundred bucks but you won"t be happy with it. I bought another case for three hundred bucks and eventually a screen protector for a hundred fifty bucks. I eventually bought a case I liked for a thousand five hundred. I ended up spending two thousand one hundred and a dozen hours looking at cases. If I had just bought the first one that I liked for a few extra hundred pesos I would have enjoyed sooner and had some extra time doing what I wanted. </p>
<p>It"s not the number of decisions made, you need to consider the duration of your decision making time. </p>
<p>Don"t keep decisions in an open loop. Here"s an exapmple: if someone invites me to an event I don"t want to go to, tell them you can"t go but will check back with them if things change instead of telling them yes and deciding later. </p>
<p>Limit your decision making time to as short as possible. Time wasted deciding and time wasted worrying make your life suck. Use the parameters to make decisions instead. That way you can be more productive and move forward. </p>

<p>The effort required to succeed and to fail is the same.</p>
<p>You will wake up. </p>
<p>You will work.</p>
<p>You will spend money and time on necessities and something else.</p>
<p>The difference is where you put your spare money and spare time.</p>
<p>If you don"t like the results you are getting, you can look at how you are spending your spare resources. Try something <a href="http://www.dgfev.com/">online casino</a>  else.</p>
<p>If you have a kid, when do you quit trying to teach him or her how to walk? Until he or she walks right? You don"t quit and say I"ve used too much resources. </p>
<p>Never lose heart. Failure is directly related to the strategy used or the skill level of your execution.</p>

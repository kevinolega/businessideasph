<p>Everyone"s an expert is the third installment on how to build a website that people go to by Seth Godin. I"m paraphrasing a bit.</p>
<p>Seth talks about how people don"t search for things to buy online. People search to make sense of things and take action based on what makes sense for them to do so.</p>
<p>High traffic blogs receive a lot of traffic for a specific reason. The reader trusts the author as a reliable source. One of the key factors is that a real person is in charge of the website and not a faceless corporation. People want opinions more than we might think. Your view point matters.

What you just read, your wish list, your Flickr photos and so on. This website is now my lens.</p>

<p>There are many ways to build a lens. Seth recommends squidoo. I also noticed Leo Babauta of <a href="http://ZenHabits.tumblr.com" rel="nofollow">ZenHabits has a tumblr account as his lens</a>. What is your lens?</p>

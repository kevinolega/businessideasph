When I was younger, I had the habit of bashing the competition. It makes me feel smart and superior. I get to reinforce that I have the better option with me to myself. 

What I didn't realize until much later is that I succeeded in getting the customer do doubt what I say about the benefits of my proposal. I am only successful in getting the prospective customer to defend the status quo, their current choice.

I have lost so many deals bashing the competition both in business and in my personal life.  

If I tell them something bad about what they have, I practically told them how bad they are with their decision making process for picking the wrong choice.

Here's how to correct it.

If you assume that they are good at selecting the best choice at the situation you will approach it differently. You see the situation changes and what may be best then may not be the best option right now. 

Assume that they have the best and say nice things about what they have. If they do then they will confirm that you are right and you can be happy for them. If not then they will tell you the truth and you will be given an opportunity to offer a solution.

Here's some ways to apply it.

If you're trying to recruit someone. Instead of saying our company is so awesome our offer is so and so. Tell them you're grateful and excited that they spent some time to look at your opportunity. When you found out that they worked at their current job at their position you presumed that they're doing well financially and they enjoy the challenges of the work very much. If that's true you can be happy for them and you can just discuss the opportunity casually and you're not trying to get their approval anymore. Better options result from this kind of conversations.  

If a customer is currently using a product or service similar to what you're offering. You may begin asking them what got them interested in taking a look at your product or service because you heard good things about their current provider. This gives you an opportunity to discuss what they like about their current provider, what they don't like about their current provider and what changes they'd like to make. This enables you to customize the offer or customize how you would present the offer to your prospect.

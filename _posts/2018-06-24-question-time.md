When you find yourself overwhelmed, here is one question that you can ask yourself to get back into focus.

> "What is the best use of my time?"

We all have long work days.

We all have too many things that need to get done.

Get a notebook.

Write down the question:
"What is the best use of my time?"

Write down as many details as you can.

Consider areas of your personal life and your business.

Perhaps you can start with a list of activities and from there ask yourself the question again.

What is the best use of my time?

In order to be productive, you need to successfully accomplish your top priorities instead of being busy.

What is the best use of my time?

You can modify the question and ask yourself:

What is the best use of my resources?

Asking yourself this question will change your life.

<p>The purpose of business is to make money. If your starting out and you don"t have experience running a business you need to make money in the first two weeks before you invest any further. </p>
<p>When I tried a buy and sell business I made money immediately and then invested more money in the business. Unfortunately I invested more money "playing business" than making money. </p>
<p>When I sold food at work I also made money immediately.&nbsp; I also learned that the hard part was not selling but <a href="http://www.jameshallison.com/">online casinos</a> staying focused. There"s a lot of distractions. New products. Marketing to Unfortunately, many students pay to go through training truck driver training and then are not able to find a <a href="https://best-driving-school.com/about-driving/drivers-ed-online">free online drivers ed</a> job because they do not meet the minimum hiring requirements for most companies. new customers and covering different areas. I feel like the growth <a href="http://www.nbso.ca/">casino online</a>  is happening too soon and when it does I get distracted playing business. </p>
<p>It"s fun telling other people you have a business selling whatever. It"s also fun to do research and do other shit like attending seminars and reading.&nbsp; Sadly, none of these activities make money. It actually costs you more money. </p>
<p>Here"s what I remind myself to steer away from the downward spiral that hit me the last time and killed my buy and sell business. </p>
<p>1. Sell and deliver product or service.<br />
2. Make money.<br />
3. Ensure you are reaching a regular income.<br />
4. Stop investing in the business until items 2 and 3 are fulfilled. </p>
<p>What problems have you learned from in your business?</p>

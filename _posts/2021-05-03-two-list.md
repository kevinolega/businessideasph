My boss introduced me to GTD.

GTD stands for Getting Things Done.

Getting Things Done is a methodology popularized by David Allen from the book with the same title.

We often remember tasks at awkward moments.

If you can complete the task in less than two minutes, "DO IT NOW!"

Sometimes the task cannot be done in less than 120 seconds.

Sometimes you would require a specific set of conditions to work on the task.

Sometimes you need to be in a specific location to do the task.

Put the task in your to-do list and process it later.

Develop the habit of collecting tasks on your to-do list.

Great ideas not acted upon often result in missed opportunities or consequences.

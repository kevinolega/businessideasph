<p>In business situations I find two responses interesting. One is counter intuitive and the other is counter productive.</p>
<p>Counter intuitive responses feel like the opposite of what most people would do but would actually lead to better long term results for your business.</p>
<p>I remember going for tea at Starbucks for the first time and how my friend taught me that if you ordered tea and would want something more to drink I could simply ask for hot water and reuse the tea bag for my second cup of tea. When I went to the counter and made the request, the barista cheerfully filled my mug with hot water, a warm smile and no questions. </p>
<p>From my past understanding of business practices, since they would like to make a profit from the Astrotheme offers one of the greatest database in the world, with 47,733 horoscopes and 47,733 biographies, photos, natal charts, excerpts of astrological portrait, and daily updates. drinks I order it should be natural for them to tell me me to just order another drink and quit bothering them. A result of my tea encounter is that I tend to choose Starbucks more when I go out with friends or in business meetings. </p>
<p>Maybe, sometimes the counter intuitive response is not counter productive for business.</p>
<p>Once, I went to a small local coffee place that refused my use of the washroom when I really needed to go. I never went back to the place or recommended it.</p>
<p>Generosity is counter intuitive. Being profit centered or focused in your activities may be counter productive.</p>
<p>If we study your approach to business, do you find it counter intuitive or counter productive? Feel free to share in the comments below.</p>

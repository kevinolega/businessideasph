Gawa ka ng samples for YouTube channels you follow na mukhang wala pang editor.

Alternatively, gawa ka ng samples for YT channels na kaya mo daigan yung editor. 

STEP 1: Go through your YouTube subscriptions.

STEP 2: Check their videos.

Bonus points if you've been hitting like and leaving comments.

STEP 3: If they don't have an editor, edit a small part of their video.

OPTION 1: You can build your version of a full video (if you have lots of free time).

OPTION 2: You can build a YouTube short.

I recommend doing both depending on your available time.

STEP 4: Create a separate YouTube channel.

Do not use your main YouTube channel for this task.

Name your channel - YOUR NAME VIDEO EDITING - SAMPLES

STEP 5: Upload the video.

Include the appropriate tags.

Include the words "YOUR NAME Video Editing Services - Sample video" in the description.

Include: Software used.

Include: Hours spent editing video.

Include: Price Estimates (How much do you charge to make an exact video like this.) Don't worry, you can change this later.

Include the link to the original video.

Include "Please contact me at name@email.com for video editing inquiries."

Add the word - SAMPLE VIDEO at the end of the title.

STEP 6: Contact the creator or admin of the channel.

Hi there!

My name is NAME!

I'm a video editor from Manila.

I'm a big fan of your work.

I love your DESCRIBE YOUR FAVORITE VIDEOS.

I'm wondering if you're open to hiring video editors at the moment.

I took a clip from TITLE OF FAVORITE VIDEO and attempted to make my own version.

LINK TO SAMPLE I CREATED.

I'd love to hear about what you think.

Please let me know if you need additional help.

Thanks!

NAME

P.S. By the way, I understand that you're busy and may not be able to reply.


STEP 6: Repeat the process 200 times.

You accomplish four things.

Accomplishment 1: You get 2-4 clients. The closing ratio of sales is 1-2% success and 98-99% failure. Good job!

Accomplishment 2: You now have a portfolio of 200 videos. The next time a client asks for samples, you have something to show. This YouTube channel can also help you save time. Having samples protect you from clients who ask you to do free work or sample work because you now have samples.

Accomplishment 3: 98-99% of people won't buy from you. But that's okay! Careers aren't built overnight. It takes five to ten years to build a successful freelance business. My first job is 6k a month. I'm now earning my dream income with what I do following this exact formula. The 98-99% can become friends, give referrals, and provide you with FEEDBACK. The additional eyes can help you discover what you're missing so you can improve. 

Accomplishment 4: The 200 videos, views, watctime, and so on function as a credibility indicator so your community (friends, family, professional contacts) will look to you as a true video professional instead of a hobbyist. NOTE: 99.99% of people won't do this. Many newbies tend to depend on luck and quit when life gets difficult.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Good luck.

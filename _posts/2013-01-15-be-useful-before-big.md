<blockquote><p>Art is like masturbation. It is selfish and introverted and done for you and you alone. Design is like sex. There is someone else involved, their needs are just as important as your own, and if everything goes right, both parties are happy in the end.</p>

<p>A few years ago I get several business ideas and think what if. When I started building stuff on the web I had a mix of different ideas that seemed to take off then plateau.</p>
<p>I then built the popular blog <a href="http://callcentertrainingtips.com" rel="nofollow">Call Center Training Tips</a> and the traffic took off. Early on I Desperate longing to vanity reigns in mind of this was thinking about how things can be unique, cool, or different. I realized that when my blog’s traffic spiked from 85 unique visitors to 4,000 unique visitors per month something different had occurred. I realized that I was building something useful to others. I got comments, readers and subscribers.</p>
<p>Most of my ideas are for gratifying myself. But when something is truly useful it will land on it’s audience.</p>
<p>I loved Apple products because they are easy to use out of the box.</p>
<p>I loved Google products because they work even if I have to switch to a different computer.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking big, be useful first. Then you can grow.</p>
<p>This post is inspired by this video.</p>

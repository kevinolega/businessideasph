You might have heard of the Pareto principle. 

80% of the results is an output of 20% of the activities.

It"s easy to be overwhelmed but the fact is, 80% of all the activities are often unnecessary busy work that you can go without.

### Do a regular self check. Ask yourself the following questions...

What are the 20% of the business activities that is bringing in 80% of the profit?

How do I do more of that?

What are the 20% of factors that causes me to waste resources ( like attention, time and money)?

How do I do less of that?

The small things you do everyday, build up over time and snowball into a giant result whether positive or negative.

What does your 20% look like? 

What 20% needs to change?

Spam is generally bad for email and social media. 

It's annoying and it wastes time. 

The way spam is used, is often when you build a super generic letter or text message or blog post then hope the party receiving your message is compelled to take action and buy what you're trying to sell.

I used the spam strategy early on. 

I often printed dozens of copies of my resume and went to companies that accepted walk in applications.

Using brute force and large numbers seemed to makes sense when you're starting out because you have nothing to lose.

At the time I thought that this was the only effective way.

As I became more successful, I levelled up and played in a bigger league, I found spamming to be less effective. 

I also started to notice that I'm annoyed whenever people I know are spamming me.

I totally get it.

I know you have a message to get across, people don't mind someone telling them about something they can buy. 

However, spamming feels the same as getting a megaphone in the ear.

I wouldn't want to be a the receiving end of spam and eventually I stopped. Cold turkey. Just like [how I quit facebook](http://minimalchanges.com/why-i-chose-to-live-without-facebook).

Spamming happens because we're afraid of rejection and failure because the faster we move, the less we feel the sting of rejection.

We deliver our message to a large audience so we don't hear the "no's" and as a result we'd rather be ignored.

We'd rather hear noise.

There's always a better way. 

I know there are more but here are a few that I use and recommend:

**Listen** 

Sometimes your best ideas aren't brought out because you're spamming your current one.

**Be specific**  

Getting what you want achieved is the goal and not pleasing everybody. 

There are a few important people who want and need to hear your message. 

Get it across by speaking their language. 

They have to get it and not everybody.

Get the no's as a no and see if you can do better when you try something else. 

I use the spam strategy when I don't want to feel the no's. 

Getting rejected doesn't feel painful in reality it's just my fear that's making things painful. 

Come on, say it! "I'm rejected and it feels very painful!" 

Afterwards, I learned that the rejection is not as painful as I imagined.

Try it for yourself and you'll discover too that rejections are harmless.

What's your strategy to go beyond spamming?

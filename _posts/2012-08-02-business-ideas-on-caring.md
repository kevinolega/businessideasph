<p>Entrepreneurs have the tendency to do the exact opposite of the status quo. One may go in a certain direction while one may go the other way. In the end you will pick what works for you.</p>
<p>Today we"ll look at care. What it means and how it affects your business. Two of my most respected business role-models had two totally different statements about caring.</p>
<p>Tim Ferriss says that when negotiating..</p>
<h3>"He who cares less wins"</h3>
<p>When negotiating for anything the party who has less to lose and care"s less about whether the deal pushes through or not wins the negotiation. In my experience every time I felt that the deal needed to push through the two things happen:<br />
1. The transaction does not push through<br />
2. The transaction does push through but both parties feel that they"ve been ripped off. Which makes us want to cancel the transaction or do sloppy work in the implementation or product delivery stage.</p>
<p>To find quality clients you have to go through quantity. Look for more customers then evaluate carefully before transacting a deal. Don"t be in a rush before going after each other"s pants as you might be dissapointed with what you find.</p>
<p>It should be a win win for the both of you or no deal should push through. With that said don"t be afraid to loose a deal. You can make money if you work hard but if you loose your reputation then it will be harder for you to make money.</p>
<p>Two good reasons to let go of a deal:<br />
1. You have to over promise when you know that you or your product will underdeliver (or lie through your teeth)<br />
2. You"re taking a deal where your needs will not be met. If you take peanuts for pay then your work attitude will be like that of a monkey no matter how good or kind-hearted you are.</p>
<p>Seth Godin says..</p>
<h3>"A person who cares the most wins."</h3>
<p>We <a href="http://www.tiltongroup.com/">live</a> in a world where jobs are taken over by technology or outsourced to the Philippines.</p>
<p>With everyone offering cheaper and cheaper products and services how will your business strive without participating in this losing battle?</p>
<p>When I checked freelancer sites like oDesk, eLance or Freelancer. There"s a large influx of Indians willing to charge less than one dollar for an hour of work when the standard is eight to twenty dollars.</p>
<p>Despite that I learned from several clients that. They learned the hard way and call this phenomenon. Indian price. We charge about ten dollars an hour to do software development work. They said that if you would like to pay Indian price be prepared to receive Indian quality work.</p>
<p>Seth Godin shares in his book Linchpin, that if you want to win in an economy where everyone is trying to win with the best price don"t fight a losing battle and play at that <a href="http://www.cillap.com/">online casino</a>  game. Win by providing the best quality. Care enough to give the best quality you are capable of.</p>
<p>In my experience it is evident that a lot of companies don"t care because of the massive amount of low quality goods and bad service. Whenever I have a request to customer service, the representative answers like a prosecuting lawyer would speak to the opposing party would in order to not grant a request.</p>
<p>For example I asked a telecom company to change my plan but charged me a couple of months worth of "adjustment fee".</p>
<p>I once asked a really large bank to reverse the fee for falling bellow maintaining balance because I had to take money out during an emergency and returned the funds within that same month.</p>
<p>Both companies said that you signed in the contract yada yada yada.</p>
<p>If you want to win in your business then you need to care. Care by:<br />
1. Providing great quality to your product or service<br />
2. Provide great after sales customer service.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We are really pleased with our revenues but our goal isn"t to make <strong>money</strong>. It sounds a little flippant, but it"s the truth. Our goal and what makes us excited is to make great products. If we are successful people <strong>will</strong> like them and if we are operationally competent, we <strong>will</strong> make <strong>money</strong></p>

<p>Personally I think you do care. Personally I think you deeply want to care. Someone you respect just told you that you"re a fool or you"ll lose money trying to care. Why won"t an Apple fan let go of his "overpriced iPhone" despite being dwarfed by the specifications of the current and affordable Android phones? That"s because someone cared enough to meet his/her needs when nobody did. That"s how you get permanent brand loyalty.</p>
<p>How much do you care about what you do?</p>

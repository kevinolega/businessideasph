I have an executive desk at home.

I'm not really productive on it.

I've achieved more a Starbucks, a coworking space, a friend's dining room.

Later on I realized what's wrong with the picture.

The dining table works well as a desk because there's less shit to fuck around with.

The excutive desk has a shitload of drawers and toys and tools and other items.

The dining table has no distractions.

The dining table is just a surface. 

If you're having difficulty being productive, try working from the dining table.

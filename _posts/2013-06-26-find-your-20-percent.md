<p>You might have heard of the Pareto principle. 80% of the results is an output of 20% of the activities.</p>
<p>It"s easy to be overwhelmed but the fact is, 80% of all the activities are often unnecessary busy work that you can go without.</p>
<p>Do a regular self check. Ask yourself the following questions...</p>
<p>What are the 20% of the things I"m doing that causes to make my business more profit?</p>
<p>How do I do more of that?</p>
<p>What are the 20% of factors that causes me to waste resources ( like attention, time and money)?</p>
<p>How do I do less of that?</p>
<p>The small things you do everyday, build up over time and snowball into a result. What does your 20% look like? What 20% needs to change?</p>

I recently listened to Seth Godin at Tim Ferriss Show. 

I got to take down notes and after reading found several useful ideas and I decided to share here.

Enjoy.

**What to track:**

Stop tracking failures. 

Track progress instead. 

Redefine yourself as someone who gets things done. 

The narrative is up to you. 

It's not done to you, it's something you choose.

**On small:**

What is the smallest possible footprint that I can get away with?

What is the smallest possible project that I can do right now?

What is the smallest number of people that I can make a difference to?

Small puts you into a position where you can do something.

Small is doable.

Smallest is achievable.

Big on the other hand gives you and excuse to fail because you are chasing something that's out of your current range.

Infinity gives you a place to hide.

Look at the small.

Smallest possible market.

If you can't do 50, you can't do 50k.

**On focus and risk**

Be on the one medium where people can find you.

You don't have a lifeboat.

Risk being known for one thing.

**On shortcuts**

The long cut is the shortcut.

**On fear and failure**

The lessons we remember are the lessons we learned the hard way. 

We win by learning from failure.

Caring means we need to figure out how to move forward by identifying where the fear is and finding a way to make it work.

Dance with the fear.

Fear tells you where you need to go.

**Defining Business and brands**

My business is...

- Engaging with people who trust me
- Delivering enough value to them
- Making enough money to do it again.

The brand is the promise that you make implicitly and explicitly.

The brand people prefer, is one that consistently keeping promises.

My brand is calm, professional, that gets the job done, right now.

If you didn't get the setup correct yesterday, the second best time to do it (fix your setup) is right now.

The stories people tell about you is unfair and incorrect.

So many things people don't know about me.

My brand is not the same to everyone.

My job is to consistently and persistently show up in a way that amplifies the message of my brand.

Meaningful specific or wandering generality.

It's not what you do but what you don't do. You need to decide early what brand you want and build the story you're trying to tell people.

What is the narrative?

What are the boundaries?

Communicate the narrative and the boundaries.

Not to everyone. Only the people you seek to change.

Brands are built around the edges.

**Needs**

Humans don't need just what's new. Humans need to..
- be connected 
- be seens 
-understood, get what they need when they need.

**Becoming the Key Supplier**

I want to be someone where I will be the consistent regular choice. 

I'm going for someone who is happily engaged. 

Become the key supplier. I get the gig not because I am cheaper but because I am better. 

I'm better at..
- knowing the customer 
- being flexible
- better at going the extra mile
- better at keeping my promises. 

When I un-commoditize my work by making my work more human. 

Human is being responsible. 

Be trusted by people who want to hear more from you.

**On applying focus**

Decide who you are and everything else, including references, scale, projects will follow. 

Embrace that what you pick disables everything else that you can't pick.

**Questions to ask**

Does this advance me in the change I'm trying to do?

Does this help me keep my promises?

**Additional lessons**

Here's something else I learned listening to Seth

**More perfect**
Most people in the US can't cook. So you would think that reaching out to the masses with entry-level cooking instruction would be a smart business move.

In fact, as the Food Network and cookbook publishers have demonstrated over and over again, you're way better off helping the perfect improve. You'll also sell a lot more management consulting to well run companies, high end stereos to people with good stereos and yes, church services to the already well behaved.

Thank you for lending me your time.

I responded to this question.

I'm earinging $6 an hour at my current work. 

I'm having difficulty because my client is constantly low-balling me. 

What should I do? 

Should I quit my job and look for a more generous client? 

I have a family and expenses.

I don't have a lot of savings.

What should I do? 

Here's my advice:

Keep your job.

Endure another three or six months.

Start looking for new clients. 

Find clients that will take up your available time.

Don't quit yet. 

Get the next client. 

Having a $6/hour job allows you to get clients that pay $10-12 an hour.

It's extremely difficult and frustrating looking for decent clients when you are earning $0 an hour.

Secure a job offer first before transferring over.

When you secure a client, let your old client know that you are considering a $12 job offer. 

Your old low-balling client has two options. 

Your client can give you a raise to keep you or say goodbye.

Please be considerate to your old client and render the needed help until they get your replacement.

Avoid any immediate resignations if you can.

You'll still depend on your old client for testimonials and recommendations.

You can also pass on work to your old clients when the opportunity presents itsself.

You'll need to build a good service and client network as a freelancer.

Let me know if you have questions.

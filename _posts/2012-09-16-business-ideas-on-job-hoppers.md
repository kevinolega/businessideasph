<p>Treat people better. Many companies hate people who job hop. There"s a reason for that. When you job hop you notice how employees are treated differently and you compare between companies you have been to. </p>
<p>When an employee says in an interview that a perk of hiring them is that they have a collection of great business practices from past work experience the managers worry that this person has inside scope on industry practices and compensation packages. </p>
<p>It"s interesting that during entry level negotiations, new hires are not allowed to disclose their package even after they were told that it"s a standard package for that position? Was management lying during negations to keep the monthly salary as low as possible?</p>
<p>Here"s an interesting idea. Is it possible <a href="http://mobile.ae.org/">mobile.ae.org</a>  that job hoppers move around because they have higher standards? If the business owners or managers treat them like trash they"d leave and find their luck elsewhere. By luck I mean opportunity meeting their preparation. By job hopping these employees acquired a good number of company secrets, best business practices and points of view. Some business owners pay a good amount of money for this information. </p>
<p>Since job hoppers have higher standards, wouldn"t it be awesome if your company hired and kept job hoppers? Think about it. </p>
<p>If you get to hire and keep job hoppers what does it say about how your company treats its people? Wouldn"t that attract better quality people like what Google is doing?</p>
<p>Do you have ideas about job hoppers and how to treat people better? Consider sharing in the comments below.</p>

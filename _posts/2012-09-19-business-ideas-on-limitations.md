<p>We all have our limitations. We can"t really say we have it all for the customer. If your business sells through sales people that can be a problem. </p>
<p>If you tell your sales people that the company has everything they need then they will promise the company they are selling to that your company will have everything. </p>
<p>When that happens, your new clients will. expect everything from your company and when they realize that you don"t after long calls with customer service then you"re screwed. </p>
<p>You wrecked the sales person"s reputation. You wasted resources on your customer service reps time. You put in unnecessary and excessive demand to your implementation team. </p>
<p>Worst, your customer will remember that your company lied to them. We all know what happens if you repeat this process right. </p>
<p>Consider this alternative. </p>
<p><strong>If you know limitations you can say no to a lot of prospective deals but find the right ones.</strong> This will make things better for everyone. If you are honest about what you can"t do then your sales people can bring you the right deals. </p>
<p>Will you be willing to be honest about your limitations?</p>

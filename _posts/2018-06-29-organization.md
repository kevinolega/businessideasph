I wrote this and posted it in a small photo frame in my room that serves as a makeshift whiteboard.

> "Organizations are powerful because they are organized."


This is the quote I'm pondering.

Being organized is a state that brought out my focus and resulted in me being productive at enough important tasks that moved my goals forward.

Since I began working, I've fantasized about businesses.

I've read about them. 

I've worked in them with the intention of starting one.

I've attempted to start a business. It failed.

I've attempted to buy a business. It failed. 

I've attempted to work in one with the intention of just being a good worker. I did well.

Over time, I understood more about it than I did back when I was studying to build one.

The less interested I was about owning a business the more I understood about how well businesses run. 

Managing your business is a lot like managing your person.

You'll need to do well at earning money.

You'll need to do well at getting good value for your resources and spending only what you need.

You'll need to move forward with your important goals, even if it's just a little every day because over time it will amount to a lot every day.

One key about businesses that run well is how things are organized.

Here are common time wasters in business that I have personally encountered.

1. Not knowing what to do and as a result, meditating and fantasizing.
2. Looking for things that are missing.
3. And so on.

Here are a few details I've seen in businesses that run well.

1. Employee knows where everything is and is able to employ resources when necessary.
2. A checklist of tasks allow the employee to review what they need to do on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.

Focus enables deliberate action and is a byproduct of organization.

If productivity is an issue check the status of the focus and if focus is the issue check how well things are organized.

The application of specificity is not limited to what leaders tell their staff, it is also visible in how the information, resources and environment is organized.

1. Be extremely specific.
2. Keep clutter out of the way.
3. Make resources accessible and non-essensials inaccessible.

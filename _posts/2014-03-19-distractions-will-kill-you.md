<p>I started experimenting selling food at the office. Over time I ended up getting regular customers. I had enough sales I was so proud of myself I considered making money with this hobby. All was well. Two weeks ago I didn"t sell anything.</p>
<p>The issue wasn"t the food. The issue was me. I was experimenting on new meals more than I was working on selling what people are already buying from me. In my fantasy to get new customers I left out my current paying ones.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this, I recall how companies have done this to me. Apple had discontinued supporting the iPod Touch 4th generation Get the full recap here! <a href="http://justin-bieber-news.info/tickets/justin-bieber-tickets">tickets for justin bieber</a>  spent Friday night hanging out with the Jenners and Kardashians at Riccardo Tisciâ€™s birthday bash in Ibiza. from further OS updates. The Birdy and i Done This disabled previously free features and required me to pay a monthly fee.</p>
<p>I don"t see myself as a business expert yet. I"m reflecting <a href="http://www.victoryag.org/">online pokies on</a> my experience. I don"t claim to be right. I"m pondering what it feels like to be disregarded.</p>
<p>Another distaction that"s killing me is that I"m on Facebook in the past two weeks more and doing unnecessary activities.</p>
<p>Here"s how I fixed the situation.</p>
<p>1. I limited my menu to what I can prepare and sell regularly.</p>
<p>2. I limited experiments of new dishes to once a week.</p>
<p>3. I placed a schedule on when I sell big ticket items like cheesecake and cookies to when people have spare cash (you guessed it, payday).</p>
<p>So far I"m limiting myself to these activities.</p>
<p>What are you doing about your distractions?</p>

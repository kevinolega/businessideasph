## Finance
**Invoice**
Generating invoice to students and managing invoices from suppliers take a lot of time.

When you automate the system, excessive editing is eliminated and errors are reduced when invoices are automatically generated.

You can cut the time and accurately maintain an elevated level of cash flow. 

Invoices can be reviewed or created on the fly.
Â 
Standard reports from Invoicing Report, Sales Analysis reports, un-posted Invoices and others keep you up-to-speed on anticipated cash receipts.
	
**Payroll**
Payroll can generate a lot of stress.  A missed deadline or incorrect filing of taxes can result in fines or jail time. 

Automation enables you to avoid errors with withholding taxes in each paycheck and make sure accurate amounts are paid to the correct government agency.

Instead of a manual process where a lot of time can be wasted attempting to calculate everything correctly you can have a system in place that will require very little input because after adding employee wage information and hours, the software calculates the information including withholdings automatically. The software often automatically updates every time a tax law changes and will remind employers when to file various tax forms.

In the process you can eliminate errors in the payroll process and eliminate excessive effort involved in put calculating employee hours, wages and tax withholdings.

Also, using payroll software allows the business to compile reports at whatever pace you desire.

To start automating your processes these are the modules that we recommend that you consider. 

We also recommend a using cloud based ERP because you will have no difficulty with downloads and access everything securely from the internet.

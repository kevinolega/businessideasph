You can expand your email list by sending a message to your Linkedin contacts.

Write a short invitation like this:

Dear FIRSTNAME,

I started sending out one email per week with some advice on "NEWSLETTER TOPIC".

The emails are getting great feedback and I was wondering if you'd like me to include you.

If so, please click here to subscribe:

When you're done, you can go to your connections and send a message to each one.

If you are lazy, starting your message with "Hi there!" can be "good enough" but based on experience, referring to a person through their first name has better results.

Some tips about doing this yourself especially if you have a lot of contacts:

- Keep a slow and steady pace because you need to be careful.
- One wrong click or (double-click) can take you to the person's profile and if you're in a middle of a long list, it will take you several minutes to go back to the spot where you were working on.
- Click the white space and look carefully at the pointer before you make another click.

If you have long list and need help, we can pilot your Linkedin account and send your messages for you.

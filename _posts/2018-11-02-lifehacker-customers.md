I'm going to be upfront about this post. 

I consider myself a lifehacker type of customer.

That said this post may contain some personal bias.

Lifehacker customers are not the best customers as far as profit goes.

You don't really earn much from them because they often always buy only the best deals.

If you get "creative" with your price, it's easy for them to see through most markerting gimmicks because as a standard practice they compare deals on the internet.

Lifehackers also colaborate and coordinate with other lifehackers following each other's blog posts and sharing recommendations.

Anything less than "bang for the buck" is not good enough for them.

Lifehackers spend more time and effort studying a product or service before buying.

In a sales situation, the lifehacker customer will ask the most questions.

Some questions will include exploring the possible weakness and disadvantages of a deal as well as possible hidden costs.

Lifehackers are typically early adapters and are percieved by their peer group as highly intelligent and as a result the go to person for recommendations.

**What are the disadvantages of having a lifehacker type client or customer?**

Lifehackers often only buy what they need.

They avoid buying extras they don't need.

They often buy what they want only if it's on sale or the deal is really good.

You don't get to charge them extra so you don't make as much money. 

You often only break even or make little profit.

**What are the advantages of having lifehacker type customers?**

Lifehackers are influential. 

Whether in a blog or just their peer group. 

You get a lifehacker's recommendation, the number of your customers can multiply. 

You don't get a lot of direct profit but you have the potential to get a lot of referrals.

**How does your business respond to lifehackers?**

I started buying beef from an upscale but affordable meat shop that also offers a cooking service.

I started a "Carnivore diet" so I began buying all my meat from them.

Since I worked nearby and my workplace had a microwave, I had no use for their cooking service so I just bought the meat from them and microwaved the beef at my office pantry.

One day I left my salt at home. So I asked if I could get some salt and pepper. My food tasted better and I decided I'll also buy dinner from the place since I didn't get to prepare meals in advance that day. Later that day I craved for some steak tartare. After getting the butcher to chop up the meat for me, I had them put the meat in the container I brough took a few squirts of Worchestershire sauce, ketchup, salt, pepper and hot sauce from their customers area. As I was paying, one of the staff approached me and asked me to not do that again.

It's forbidden to take condiments to marinade the meat if I'm not using their cooking service. If I bought the meat raw, then it should leave the store raw and sealed. The staff also said it in a way that I've violated one of their laws.

We've been having issues with this place since we worked nearby and had to argue to borrow some utensils after we bought a large order.

Given the specific nature of my diet and the convenience of the location, I'll probably still buy my meat from the same place. The experience wasn't pleasant so despite liking some of the deals, I don't really recommend going to the place unless they have specific needs as I do.

I recently wrote this message and posted in a Facebook group that I'm active at.

Here's the post:

Napakaganda ng R2APH community.

Na-encourage ako mag-sulat dito.

Marami akong nakilalang friends.

Nakaka-inspire ang mga kwento dito.

Maroon lang akong dalawang concern.

1. Maraming readers ang bata pa at madaling utoin.

2. Pera, business, at kinabukasan ang madalas pinag-uusapan dito.

3. Minsan, may mga naka-pasok na scammers at swindlers.

Mag-report po kayo sa admin kung may nakikita kayong spam or illegal comments.

1. I-report ang mga MLM/Pyramid Scheme.

2. I-report ang mga get-rich quick scheme.

3. I-report ang mga high-risk at speculative invetments.

Ang #3 ay para lamang sa mga accredited investors at professional investors. 

FURTHER READING: Please Google: Accredited Investor and Professional Investor.

Please Google: Net-worth needed to become an accredited investor.

If you are selling high-risk/speculative investments to people who own less than fifty-million pesos, ₱50,000,000 hindi po tama ang ginagawa niyo.

Kinukuhaan niyo po ng pera ang mga taong walang alam sa investment.

Lahat po ng legit na financial advisor dito ay napag-aralan yan.

Ang mga financial advisor dito na under ng mga reputable na companya ay tinuturuan ang clients na umiwas sa mga investment fraud.

Rule 501 of Regulation D indicates that for an individual to be an accredited investor, they must have a net worth of more than $1 million, excluding the value of their primary residence, or they must meet certain annual income benchmarks.

Hangang dito nalang muna.

Here's the English version.

I love the R2APH community.

I felt encouraged after I started posting here.

I've made several friends in this group.

I feel inspired reading the stories here.

I do have a concern.

1. There are a lot of young impressionable readers here.

2. Some of the topics are about money, business, investments, and planning for the future.

3. Some scammers have found a way to infiltrate the group.

Please report, and call out suspicious comments on this group.

1. Please call out MLM/Pyramiding schemes.

2. Please call out get-rich quick schemes.

3. Please call out high-risk and speculative investments.

#3 should only be available to accredited investors.

FURTHER READING: Please Google Accredited Investor and Professional Investor.

Please Google Net-worth needed to become an accredited investor.

If you are selling high-risk/speculative investments to people who own less than fifty-million pesos, ₱50,000,000 you're not doing the right thing.

Financial advisors follow rules before engaging clients and recommending investments.

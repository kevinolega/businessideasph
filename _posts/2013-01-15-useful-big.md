> "For an idea to get big, it has to be useful."
- Derek Sivers


A few years ago I get several business ideas and think what if. 

When I started building stuff on the web I had a mix of different ideas that seemed to take off then plateau.

I then built the popular blog about [how to build confidence to get hired in customer service jobs](http://callcentertrainingtips.com) and the traffic took off. 

Early on I was desperately scouring the internet on ideas on how to grow vanity metrics. 

I really want to make my blogs unique, cool or different.

I realized that when my blog’s traffic spiked from 85 unique visitors to 4,000 unique visitors per month something different had occurred. 

I realized that I was building something useful to others. 

I got comments, readers and subscribers.</p>

Most of my ideas are for gratifying myself. 

But when something is truly useful it will land on it’s audience.


I loved Apple products because they are easy to use out of the box.

I loved Google products because they work even if I have to switch to a different computer.

Instead of thinking big, be useful first. Then you can grow.

<p>Last week we talked about sales ratios. Sometimes we come up with a large number for sales targets. This post is all about how to handle that.</p>
<p>Here’s last week’s example:</p>
<p><em>Each person"s starting ratio is 1:3</em><br />
<em> To get 1 sale with payment you will need to submit to a prospect 3 proposals with quotation.</em><br />
<em> To get 3 proposals with quotation, you will need, 9 meetings with a new prospect.</em><br />
<em> To achieve 9 <a href="http://www.svenskkasinon.com/">casino online</a>  meetings with a new prospect, you will need to schedule 27 different appointments.</em><br />
<em> To have 27 appointments set you will need to call <a href="http://blackjacktop.co.uk/psychological-game-of-poker">online casinos</a> and/or send emails out to 81 different prospects.</em></p>
<p>You will also need to <strong>chop the large activities into smaller ones</strong> to make them manageable.</p>
<p>Here’s a sample activity plan:</p>
<p><em>81 prospects a month can be processed with 4 contacts reached a day</em><br />
<em> 27 appointments can be 3 appointments a day if you work two days a week.</em><br />
<em> 9 meetings a month can be two meetings a week.</em></p>
<p>Is this more manageable?</p>
<p>Next week we will talk about how to evaluate your sales performance.</p>
